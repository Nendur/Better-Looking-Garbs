Better Looking Garbs

Better Looking Garbs is a portrait overhaul mod combining portrait DLC and custom new material to add diversity in clothing and styles for many of the games cultures. The faces, clothing, hair and beard-styles of each source has been recombined to create new portraits.
These new portraits fill the holes still unserviced with cosmetic DLC and add gradations to the existing portrait sets.
In addition to the portraits there are updates to the army and councillor avatar models.
While based around the use of DLC assets these are not required, an installer will add dependent parts of the mod selectively.

* Over 60 portrait sets with several additional early, late and religious variants.
* 5 Vanilla face sets before portrait packs.
* 15 Vanilla clothing sets.
